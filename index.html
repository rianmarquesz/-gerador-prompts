      <textarea readonly id="prompt2">
Create the first chapter of the story that will be narrated in video format for YouTube with at least 10,000 characters. The text should be written in the third person, with clear, emotional and fluid language, as if the character were venting to the viewer. Do not use a literary style. The introduction should be around 30 seconds long and contain a strong emotional hook (a question, a shocking sentence, or a part of the twist) to keep the audience hooked until the end.

Start with a strong hook, with up to three sentences, that arouses curiosity, emotion or identification. The introduction should be around 30 seconds long and contain a strong emotional hook that immediately grabs the audience's attention. Then, add a single call to action asking the audience to comment on the city from which they are watching, in a natural and short way.

Develop the beginning of the story by introducing the main characters, the setting, the emotional context and the first signs of conflict or change.

Use long, well-rounded paragraphs, maintaining a continuous rhythm. Avoid loose sentences, poetry style or short fragments to create dramatic impact. The impact should come from the story itself, not from the form.

Remember that you should only wrap up the main plot in the last chapter, making the most important revelations and giving the characters a final ending with a climax and twists, in a satisfactory way.

The chapter should end naturally, without forced transitional or suspenseful sentences, as the story continues in the next chapter. Do not use artificial cliffhangers, just let the flow flow organically.

You can take inspiration from the structures of modern soap operas and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube.</textarea

      <h2>Prompt 03 – Continuação</h2>
      <textarea readonly id="prompt3">
Continue the story based on the previous chapter, maintaining the same style: third-person narrative, emotional, fluid and accessible, with long and cohesive paragraphs, with at least 10,000 characters. Each chapter should delve deeper into the characters, their dilemmas and their decisions. Show the conflicts gaining strength, moments of emotional tension, injustice, fragility or important revelations that build the turning point. The language should remain simple, realistic and engaging. Do not use broken sentences or exaggerated literary devices. The text should sound like a real, spoken, continuous and coherent narrative, like someone reporting something they saw happen to another person. Do not use broken sentences, do not break the text into short phrases or single words, instead, write the text only in long paragraphs, divide it into paragraphs, never in small lines alone. The end of each chapter should happen naturally, without phrases like “little did she know what was coming” or “but everything was about to change”. Do not force cliffhangers or gratuitous suspense. Just end the section as if the conversation were to continue in the next chapter.

Remember that you should only end the main plot in the last chapter, making the most important revelations and giving the characters a final ending with a climax and twists, in a satisfactory way.

      <h2>Prompt Final</h2>
      <textarea readonly id="promptFinal">
Write the final chapter of the story, with at least 10,000 characters 10,000. This chapter should contain the main emotional twist or revelation of the story, with the final outcome of the characters and the plots presented.

The narrative continues in the third person, with the same tone used in the previous chapters: accessible, fluid, emotional, and without stylistic flourishes. The text should be full-bodied, with long paragraphs, without loose sentences or artificial constructions of impact.

The conclusion should bring a clear emotional resolution, even if it is not a “happy” ending — it can be one of overcoming, justice, personal growth or simply peace. The important thing is that the audience feels that the story has been concluded with depth and truth.

Do not use broken sentences, do not fragment the text into short phrases or single words; instead, write the text only in long paragraphs, divide it into paragraphs, never in small lines alone. At the end, add a single call for comment, suggesting that the audience comment on a symbolic word related to the theme of the story (e.g.: “turnaround”, “peace”, “start over”, “courage”), briefly explaining why.

Then, invite the audience to watch another video:

“There is a story here on the screen that will also move you. Press play, you won’t regret it.”

Don’t use canvas. Don’t use divisions. Don’t end with suspenseful phrases or promises of continuation. The story should end in a natural, impactful and emotionally satisfying way.</textarea

      const textoPrompt1 = `Create a script structure divided into 8 chapters with at least 10,000 characters each, geared towards stories narrated on YouTube in the third person, with a fluid, emotional and accessible style. The stories should follow the model of contemporary urban moral fables, with a steady pace, realistic conflicts and emotional growth until a strong and revealing climax. The tone should be narrative and engaging, as if someone were telling a true story that will move, surprise, leave a clear l...

The structure should follow a classic model of increasing tension, such as Kishōtenketsu, adapted to the style of “mini contemporary urban fables” — with an engaging beginning, evident conflict, surprising twist and ending with a clear lesson or emotional reflection.

The chapters should be internal references only — they should not be identified in the final text, and the story should flow naturally from one point to the next, as a single continuous narrative. The language should be simple, clear, fluid and emotional, as if someone were telling a true story in a video. Use long paragraphs, without artificial breaks or loose sentences, and avoid any literary or poetic tone.

The script should have a steady rhythm, without stagnant sections, and with increasing emotional tension. Any major revelation should happen only at the end, with an unexpected twist and clear consequences. The conclusion should be emotional, satisfying and closed, without leaving loose ends. Use real names and common US settings to generate identification. Target audience: all ages, from 13 to 60+.

Stories should explore intense human situations that provoke immediate empathy, indignation, curiosity and emotional connection with the audience, addressing themes such as hasty judgments, discrimination, betrayals, revealed secrets, family conflicts, social tensions, abuses of power, moral challenges, everyday injustices and relationships with hidden interests. You can include elements of romance, rivalry, loss, overcoming, revenge, reconciliation or transformative revelations — as long as everything se...

The story should contain multiple characters with clear motivations, complex relationships and transformations throughout the plot. Use real settings, believable names and situations that seem possible to happen to anyone. The main climax and the most impactful revelation should only happen in the eighth chapter, with a striking, emotionally satisfying and well-rounded ending — without leaving any loose ends.

The focus is to create stories of high narrative quality, but with accessible and emotional language, adapted to the broad audience of YouTube. Generate only the structure of the story, the skeleton. Do not write the text yet. Do not use canvas.

It can be inspired by the structures of modern soap operas and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube.
